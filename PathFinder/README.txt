Version 0.9 alpha release

This is the alpha test version of PathFinder.
Here you can create, save and load different mazes that are represented by boolean arrays and visually by white/black JButtons.
You can then use the program to test a maze solving engine against different mazes that can be edited and tested in real time.

Engines by default start from the northwest(top-left) corner and try to make it to the southeast(bottom-right) corner. 


Future implementation will include 
- Preferences menu, How to play menu and finishing touches in all menus and menu-related code.
- Improved results output, improved overall design and validations.
- More information on the engines and a better system for loading and managing different engines. 

Current version only allows for 10x10 mazes but finished version will allow for potentially indefinite(*) number of squares to make up the maze.

Class PathFinder contains code written mostly by me (Caio Badner) and the method findTheExit that was adapted from a program written by Dean Dall.

This is an ongoing project that welcomes collaboration :)
