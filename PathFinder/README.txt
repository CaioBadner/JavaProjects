Version 0.9 alpha release

This is the alpha test version of PathFinder. 
Future implementation will include 
- Preferences menu, How to play menu and finishing touches in all menus and menu-related code.
- Improved results output
- More information on the engines and a better system for loading and managing different engines. 

Current version only allows for 10x10 mazes but finished version will allow for potentially indefinite(*) number of squares to make up the maze.

Class PathFinder contains code written mostly by me (Caio Badner) and the method findTheExit that was adapted from a program written by Dean Dall.
